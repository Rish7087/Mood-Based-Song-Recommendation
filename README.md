# Mood-Based-Song-Recommendation
This project demonstrates emotion detection using a webcam and recommends Spotify playlists based on detected emotions. The web application captures video from the user's webcam, analyzes their facial expressions to determine their current emotion, and then suggests a curated Spotify playlist that matches their emotional state.
